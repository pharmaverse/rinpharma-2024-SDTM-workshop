# rinpharma-2024-SDTM-workshop
Repository for the R in Pharma 2024 SDTM Workshop. We will demonstrate how to create the CM and VS domains using {sdtm.oak}. The raw data for the CM domain follows CDASH standards, while the raw data for the VS domain follows non-CDISC standards, highlighting the package's data standards and EDC-agnostic features.

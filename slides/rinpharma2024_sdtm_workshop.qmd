# Introduction to `sdtm.oak`

## About the package  {.smaller}
::: incremental
-   Sponsored by CDISC COSA, pharmaceutical companies, including Roche, Pfizer, GSK, Vertex, Atorus Research, Pattern Institute, Transition Technologies Science.
-  Part of the pharmaverse Group of packages.
-  Inspired by the Roche's {roak} package.
-  Addresses a critical gap in the pharmaverse suite by enabling study programmers to create SDTM datasets in R, complementing the existing capabilities for ADaM, TLGs, eSubmission, etc.

:::

## Challenges in SDTM Programming {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Although SDTM is simpler with less complex derivations compared to ADaM, it presents unique challenges. Unlike ADaM, which uses SDTM datasets as its source with a well-defined structure, SDTM relies on raw datasets as input.
-  **Raw Data structure** - Different EDC systems produce data in different structures, different variable names, dataset names etc.
-  **Varying Data Collection standards** - Although CDASH is available, the companies can still develop varying eCRFs using CDASH standards.

:::

## `sdtm.oak` v0.1.0 {.smaller}

::: incremental

-   v0.1.0 is avaiable on CRAN.
-  **EDC agnostic** `sdtm.oak` is designed to be highly versatile, accommodating varying raw data structures from different EDC systems and external vendors. 
-   **Data standards agnostic** It supports both CDISC-defined data collection standards (CDASH) and various proprietary data collection standards defined by pharmaceutical companies.
-  Provides a framework for modular programming, making it a valuable addition to the pharmaverse ecosystem.

:::

# Algorithms

## Key concepts

::: incremental

-  The SDTM mappings that transform the collected source data into the target SDTM data model are grouped into algorithms. 
- These mapping algorithms form the backbone of {sdtm.oak}
- Algorithms can be re-used across multiple SDTM domains.
-  **Programming language agnostic** This concept does not rely on a specific programming language for implementation.
- `sdtm.oak` has R functions to represent each algorithm

## assign_no_ct {.smaller}

| Algorithm or Function | Description of the Algorithm | Example SDTM mapping|
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `r link::to_call("sdtm.oak::assign_no_ct()")` | One-to-one mapping between the raw source and a target SDTM variable that has no controlled terminology restrictions. Just a simple assignment statement. | MH.MHTERM <br><br> AE.AETERM |

## assign_ct {.smaller}

| Algorithm or Function | Description of the Algorithm | Example SDTM mapping|
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `r link::to_call("sdtm.oak::assign_ct()")` | 	One-to-one mapping between the raw source and a target SDTM variable that is subject to controlled terminology restrictions. A simple assign statement and applying controlled terminology. This will be used only if the SDTM variable has an associated controlled terminology.| VS.VSPOS <br><br> VS.VSLAT |

## assign_datetime {.smaller}

| Algorithm or Function | Description of the Algorithm | Example SDTM mapping|
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `r link::to_call("sdtm.oak::assign_datetime()")` | 	One-to-one mapping between the raw source and a target that involves mapping a Date or time or datetime component. This mapping algorithm also takes care of handling unknown dates and converting them into. ISO8601 format.| MH.MHSTDTC <br><br> AE.AEENDTC |

## hardcode_ct {.smaller}

| Algorithm or Function | Description of the Algorithm | Example SDTM mapping|
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `r link::to_call("sdtm.oak::hardcode_ct()")` | 	Mapping a hardcoded value to a target SDTM variable that is subject to terminology restrictions. This will be used only if the SDTM variable has an associated controlled terminology.| MH.MHPRESP = ‚ÄòY‚Äô <br><br> VS.VSORRESU = ‚ÄòmmHg‚Äô |

## condition_add {.smaller}

| Algorithm or Function | Description of the Algorithm | Example SDTM mapping|
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `r link::to_call("sdtm.oak::condition_add()")` | 		Algorithm that is used to filter the source data and/or target domain based on a condition. The mapping will be applied only if the condition is met. This algorithm has to be used in conjunction with other algorithms, that is if the condition is met perform the mapping using algorithms like assign_ct, assign_no_ct, hardcode_ct, hardcode_no_ct, assign_datetime.| If MDPRIOR == 1 then CM.CMSTRTPT = ‚ÄòBEFORE‚Äô. <br><br>VS.VSMETHOD when VSTESTCD = ‚ÄòTEMP‚Äô |
